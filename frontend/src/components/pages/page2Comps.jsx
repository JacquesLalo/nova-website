When a project requires additional resources we work in unison with the most experienced production houses in the country.

## Potential synergy
A small shop in the New York area, Potential Synergy has recognized how the absence of advanced technology has walled off corners of various industries and prevented other industries from working in unison.

    const source = `The VR we develope is *programmable*  The virtual expereince can be manipulated through inputs, such as code, player interfacing or phsyiological behaviors.

The content *produced* can range from photo-real capture to entirely ficticious dreamscapes.  VR is the overlay of interactive elements within a 3D space for the player to engage the world around him.

By *networking* the software you can experience with others.  This allows for joint expreineces, collaboration and sharing.  Further, it enables markets to exist, distributed file keeping and remote access/control to other devices, virtual and physical.

There are a variety of production techniques, tools and frameworks to make XR.   They are all synchronized in a software framework called a "game engine".

A *game engine* is used to create interactive 3D media (XR).  We build XR in game engines.  They are a powerful visualization tool for developing all the features of the internet, from netowrked play to social sharing, and secure payments, into a single application.

[GAME ENGINE GRAPHIC - DIAGRAM RAINBOW COLOR]

Game engines equip developers to custom design virtual environments, program players, goals and rules as applications shared and experienced throgh personal computers, mobile dvices and gaming consules. Game engine framework's core functions are to render 3D graphics, engineer physics/collision (and response systems) manage memoreym shread, and graph scenes.

Nova economizes the process of virtual reality (XR) development by adapting game engine builds (software executable) to create new VR expereinces.   By developing with foresight producers save time and money.

Some Game Engines you may have heard of are:

Unity, Unreal, Cryengine, GameMaker Studio, HTML5, Godot, OpenGL, Blender, Source, Lumberyard, Torque, Frostbite, Doom Engine, Havok, MonkeyEngine, Panda3D, PhyreEngine, Ren'Py, ORX, ORGE, HeroEngine,RenderWare,Freescape, LithTech, GoldBox

They've all advantages and disadvantages, varying features, code , graphical interfaces and so on.   The best way to figure your favorite is to express what you want to accomplish and why - or first-hand experiment with all.`
